## Problem

  Description of your project, including:

- Problem definition / purpose:
  -	Needs single place to display all music lesson info
  -	Current way to request lessons is via phone call or facebook or in person at the school > would like more streamlined method
  -	Contact details for students often not given or are incorrect
  -	Students forget to pay
  -	Students/parents forget lesson times and when school holidays are
  -	Parents prefer to meet in person before signing up for piano lessons

- Functionality / features
- Screenshots
- Tech stack (e.g. html, css, deployment platform, etc)
  - MERN stack; MongoDB, express.js, react.js, node.js
  - Deployed to: React - Netlify, API - now.sh, MongoDB - mLab

# Instructions on how to setup, configure, deploy and use your App.
This web app runs using a JavaScript MERN stack. To setup, clone the repository from GitHub, then run npm i in both the api and client directories to install dependencies.

Start your servers on your local machine in the command line. Make sure you are in the correct directory for each of the three servers; api for API and MongoDB, and client for React.

For MongoDB:
```
 $ mongod
```

For api:

```
$ npm start
```

for React:

```
npm start
```

To deploy each server, we recommend using M-Lab for the Mongo data base, now.sh for the api, and Netlify for the React front end.

A new student can then register, log-in and book lessons.

# Design documentation

### Design process

Our design process began with white-boarding the data structure. Once this was established, we used the colour scheme and typography from our client's business card as inspiration for the design of the website and application. The layout was then created in Figma.

- User stories

Teacher (admin user)

From the admin teacher portal, the teacher is able to view student details with ease. The teacher is able to approve lesson booking requests, and view their weekly schedule. The teacher can send notifications to students via email to remind students and parents of lesson times, public holidays and other important information.

Parent/student (user)

From the user portal, the parent can keep contact details up to date, view the lesson time and location, and book lessons for each term. The parent can request their preferred lesson time.
