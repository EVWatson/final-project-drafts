## Our Client
Our client is Lilla, a self-employed, instrumental music teacher.


## Project Description

### Problem definition / purpose:

Lilla currently uses Facebook as a means to display information relevant to her teaching business. In addition to Facebook, Lilla has business cards and 


  -	Needs single place to display
  all music lesson info
  -	Current way to request lessons is via phone call or facebook or in person at the school > would like more streamlined method
  -	Contact details for students often not given or are incorrect
  -	Students forget to pay
  -	Students/parents forget lesson times and when school holidays are
  -	Parents prefer to meet in person before signing up for piano lessons

- Functionality / features
- Screenshots
- Tech stack (e.g. html, css, deployment platform, etc)
  - MERN stack; MongoDB, express.js, react.js, node.js
  - Deployed to: React - Netlify, API - now.sh, MongoDB - mLab

# Answers to the Short Answer questions (Section 2.2)

1. What are the most important aspects of quality software?

  The most important aspects of quality software are:
  - reliability; does it perform the job properly each and every time?
  - efficiency; does it take a long time to perform simple calculations or does the program work to a level of speed that isn't detrimental to work flow?
  - security; how well does the program defend against potential intrusion or data breaches?
  - usability; is the program easy to use and well designed, with a minimal amount of time needed to learn how to use it.

2. What libraries are being used in the app and why?

  The libraries used in this project are ReactJS, Axios, React-Router-Dom, Express, Passport, CookieSession, Bcrypt, Mongoose and Cors. ReactJS was a project requirement, Axios a more efficient way to manage requests to the API than fetch, React-Router-Dom for efficient routing in the front-end, Express for building the API, Passport and CookieSession for authentication, Bcrypt for hashing passwords, Mongoose for easier interface with MongoDB, and Cors to bypass the default browser setting that blocks access from other sources such as API's/browsers.

3. A team is about to engage in a project, developing a website for a small business. What knowledge and skills would they need in order to develop the project?

  The team in question would need a knowledge of the tech stacks required, be they plain HTML & CSS, JavaScript, Python, Ruby/Rails, or any number of other technologies that could be used for website construction. They would also need to know their teammate's strengths and weaknesses in order to assign appropriate tasks to appropriate people, as well as assist each other in learning new skills. They would also need a knowledge of Github, BitBucket or something similar in order to work effectively as a team and employ Agile methodology. Finally, they would require the ability to willing seek out answers to problems that arise that are outside the group's knowledge. The ability to negotiate with their client, managing expectations and meeting requirements is also invaluable, as is the ability to negotiate and work effectively and professionally as a team.

4. Within your own project what knowledge or skills were required to complete your project, and overcome challenges?

  In our project a knowledge of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, MongoDB and GitHub were required. A knowledge of where our teams strengths and weaknesses lay was also helpful for appropriate division of labour, and for creating learning and teaching opportunities between team-members. High level soft skills in negotiation and communication were also required to overcome challenges in code, data structure, and the logistics of mob-programming, pair-programming, and individual work. Finally an above average skill in google-fu was required to solve problems with code that we had theretofore not experienced.


5. Evaluate how effective your knowledge and skills were this project, using examples, and suggest changes or improvements for future projects of a similar nature?

  There were a wide variety of skills and strengths within our group, with some members more confident in their knowledge and abilities than others. This meant that while not all areas of the project could be divided into three equal parts for individual work, many teaching and learning opportunities were created. In terms of the basic set-up of React, MongoDB and Express, all members of the team were very capable. The process of working out how to implement more advanced features, particularly scheduling, proved a challenge. Our team were able to visualise how we wanted the end-product to look, but had a lot to learn in terms of how to implement this in code. With many differences of opinion, soft skills were very effective in navigating our way to mutually agreeable decisions.

  For future projects, our team will now have a better idea of managing time and adjusting our MVP to a more realistic level for the time allocated to the project. Time was also a particular concern as we were a 3, rather than 4, member team, and as such the work load was heavier. Each of us has learned a lot from the project, and progressed in a number of areas. This progression of skills would also be beneficial to future projects, as we may find we can be more ambitious with what we would like to achieve.
